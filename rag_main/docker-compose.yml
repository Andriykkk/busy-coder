# This file will orchestrate the different services using Docker Compose.

# Services:
# 1. `app`:
#    - This will be the main Python application running `main.py`.
#    - It will build from the current directory.
#    - It needs to be connected to the same network as the sandbox.
#    - Environment variables for API keys should be passed here.

# 2. `sandbox`:
#    - This will be the code execution environment.
#    - It will build using the `Dockerfile` we defined.
#    - It will expose the port (e.g., 8888) for the Kernel Gateway.
#    - The `app` service will communicate with it on this port.
