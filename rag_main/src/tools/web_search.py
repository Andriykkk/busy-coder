# This file will implement the tool for searching the web.

# Responsibilities:
# 1. Tool Definition:
#    - Inherit from `BaseTool`.
#    - Define the `name`, `signature`, and `description`.

# 2. API Integration:
#    - The `run` method will take a search `query` string.
#    - It will use a library like `langchain` or directly call a search API
#      (e.g., Google Custom Search, Tavily, Serper).
#    - It needs to handle API keys securely (e.g., from environment variables).

# 3. Result Formatting:
#    - It will receive a list of search results.
#    - It will format these results into a clean, single string observation
#      that is easy for the LLM to parse and understand.
#      For example: "Web Search Results:\n1. [Title] [Snippet] [URL]\n2. [Title] [Snippet] [URL]..."
